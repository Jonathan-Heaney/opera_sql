# Worldwide Opera Performance Data, 2012-2018

## Background

From 2015-2021, I was a professional classical pianist and opera coach. A large part of my job was to learn operas and play them in rehearsals for opera companies; I would serve as the full orchestra, which would be incorporated at the end of rehearsals and in performances.
Learning an entire opera is demanding and time-consuming. Many are over 2 or 3 hours long, most are not in English, and none were written for piano so many of them are extremely difficult to play. Moreover, given that opera has been around since the early 1600s, there are far more operas in the repertoire than would be possible for any one person to learn in an entire lifetime, much less in a few years as a student.
In this project, I explored a dataset of opera performances around the world between 2012-2018 to answer the questions that were top of mind when I was a pianist: what operas should I learn? Who are the most popular composers? What languages/countries produced the most operas? For some composers, would I be able to focus on just one of their pieces, or would I need to learn multiple from some composers? Essentially: what is the most efficient way for me to learn as much of the in-demand repertoire as possible, so I could be as hirable and effective as possible? I knew that some operas were more important and popular than others, but I wanted to quantify that popularity.
